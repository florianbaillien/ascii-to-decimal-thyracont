# ASCII to Decimal Converter

This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application created using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to input text, performs a calculation based on the ASCII values of the characters, and displays the result.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can enter any text into the application.
- **Calculation**: The application computes a specific value derived from the ASCII codes of the input text.
- **Result Display**: It shows the original text along with the calculated result in the GUI.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user enters text into the input field.
2. **Processing**: When the "Calculate" button is clicked, the application calculates the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the input text, applies a modulo operation, and appends a specific character.
3. **Output**: The original text and the calculated result are displayed in the result area.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:
   ```bash
   python3 your_script_name.py
   ```

3. **Input Text**:
   - Enter any text in the input field labeled "Enter text:".
   - Click the "Calculate" button to process the input.

4. **View Results**:
   - The original text and the calculated result will be displayed below the button.

## Example

- Input: `Hello`
- Output: `HelloA\r` (where `A` is the calculated character based on the ASCII sum).

## Notes

- The application runs in a loop until it is closed, allowing for multiple calculations without restarting.
- The calculation method can be customized for different requirements if needed.
